# Cloud SysAdmin Technical Exercise ‚Äî 2025-09

## Exercise: Design a Highly Available AWS-Based NAT Gateway Alternative

### Overview
The goal of this exercise is to **design and describe a highly available system in AWS** that provides functionality similar to a Managed NAT Gateway ‚Äî **allowing outbound connections from private subnets to the internet while blocking unsolicited inbound traffic.**

This project is part of a **technical assessment** focused on architectural reasoning, operational excellence, and automation best practices.

---

## üß© Requirements

1. **Outbound connectivity:**  
   Private subnets must be able to initiate outbound connections to the internet.
2. **Inbound security:**  
   Prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet.
3. **High availability:**  
   Fault-tolerant design spanning multiple **Availability Zones**.
4. **Scalability:**  
   Support increasing workloads gracefully.
5. **Monitoring and alerting:**  
   Include metrics, logs, and alerts to detect failures or performance issues.
6. **Security best practices:**  
   Use IAM roles, least privilege, and encrypted communications.
7. **Cost efficiency and operational simplicity:**  
   Minimize operational overhead without compromising availability.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- **Architecture diagram** illustrating all components and network flow.  
- **High-level component explanation** (bulleted, concise).  
- **Optional:**  
  - Pseudo-code or IaC snippets (e.g., failover automation, routing logic).  
  - Scripts or GitHub Actions for deployment and validation.  

---

## üßÆ Evaluation Criteria

- Clarity of design and ability to communicate trade-offs.  
- How effectively the system addresses **availability, scalability, and security**.  
- Creativity in leveraging AWS native services (while **avoiding Managed NAT Gateway**).  
- Practicality ‚Äî how easily it can be implemented and maintained.

**Description of Components**

* **EC2 NAT Instances (A & B):**
  Custom AMIs with iptables masquerade enabled, running in Auto Scaling Group.
* **NLB (Network Load Balancer):**
  Provides static IP endpoints and cross-AZ routing.
* **Route Tables:**
  Private subnets forward all `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to NLB.
* **Internet Gateway:**
  Provides outbound connectivity to the internet.
* **CloudWatch:**
  Health checks, alarms, and auto-recovery for failed instances.

## üöÄ Quick Start (manual execution)
> Shortcut: `./infra/scripts/bootstrap.sh --profile terraform-role --env test` will reapply policies (unless `--skip-iam`) and run Terraform plan/apply with the correct backend/var files.


1. **Configure AWS profiles**
   - Add the `terraform` IAM user and your admin keys to `~/.aws/credentials`.
   - Add the assume-role profile to `~/.aws/config`:
     ```ini
     [profile terraform-role]
     role_arn = arn:aws:iam::165820787764:role/nat-alternative-terraform
     source_profile = terraform
     external_id = terraform-nat-build
     region = eu-central-1
     ```
2. **Seed IAM/KMS/S3/DynamoDB (one-time per account)**
   - Review `infra/policies/*.json`, adjust ARNs if needed, then run the commands in `docs/terraform-role-setup.md`.
3. **Bootstrap Terraform remote state**
   ```bash
   cd infra
   AWS_PROFILE=terraform-role terraform init -migrate-state \
     -backend-config=backend-test.hcl
   ```
4. **Plan / Apply**
   ```bash
   AWS_PROFILE=terraform-role terraform plan \
     -var-file=environments/test/vars.tfvars

   AWS_PROFILE=terraform-role terraform apply \
     -var-file=environments/test/vars.tfvars
   ```
5. **Validate deployment**
   ```bash
   AWS_PROFILE=terraform-role ./scripts/verify_nat.sh test
   ```

Swap in the production backend (`backend-prod.hcl`) and var file when promoting.

## üé¨ Demo & Automation Roadmap

- **Terraform-first demo** ‚Äì use Terraform to deploy the full stack in a sandbox account, then run `verify_nat.sh` to confirm NAT health and routing.
- **Traffic probes** ‚Äì extend probe user-data or SSM automation to generate curl/iperf traffic, publish latency/packet-loss metrics, and store traces for demo dashboards.
- **Lambdas & maintenance** ‚Äì implement the Lambda functions described in `docs/design-notes.md` (`nat-health-probe`, `nat-route-failover`, `config-guard`, etc.) to automate failover, configuration drift checks, and probe orchestration.
- **Suggested demo flow**
  1. `terraform apply` in a clean account.
  2. Run `verify_nat.sh`, show CloudWatch metrics/flow logs.
  3. Trigger synthetic traffic via probes; present dashboards/alerts.
  4. Manually stop a NAT instance and demonstrate Lambda-driven failover once implemented.

See `docs/design-notes.md` (¬ß12) for the extended automation backlog and Lambda roadmap.
